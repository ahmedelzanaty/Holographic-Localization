# Holographic-Localization
The Mathematica code for Figure 4 the IoT Magazine paper "Towards 6G Holographic Localization: Enabling Technologies and Perspectives"
The figures shows the position error bounds vs various user equipment locations for scenarios with and without RIS.
The code also serves as the base for the figures in the following paper.
